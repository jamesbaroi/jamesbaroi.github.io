  <h5>Overview</h5>
  <p class="indent">
    This Cookie Policy lists the categories of cookies and the name of
    each cookie in each category used by this site with a brief description
    of the purpose of each cookie, the time to expiration, and the cookie's
    host provider. This Cookie Policy also describes the methods available

  <h5>1. Cookie Category</h5>
  <p class="indent">
    Four categories of cookies are defined on this site as (1) Necessary,

    consists of one or more cookie or cookies stored as key-value pairs
    of information, each in the form of a sequence of alpha-numeric
    characters. Each category consists of one or more cookies with one
    cookie in each category described as the primary cookie for that
    category that stores information about the consent to the use of that
    category of cookies. For example, "ckNec" is the name of the primary
    necessary cookie that stores information that allows or prevents the
    use of necessary cookies.

    Your consent to the use of any category of cookies acknowledges
    your consent to the use of all cookies in that category as well
    as all necessary cookies. If your consent to the use of any
    category of cookies precedes the inclusion of new cookies in that
    category, then your consent to the use of cookies in that category
    also acknowledges your consent to the use of the new cookies from
    the moment the inclusion of the new cookies has been updated on and
    made available through this document.
