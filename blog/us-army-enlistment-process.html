        Overview

      <div class="p">
        You are considering enlisting in the United States Army and are
        preparing to meet with your local recruiter for the first time. You may
        be wondering, "What is the enlistment process really like?" Recognizing
        that there are many articles available on this subject that enumerate
        the general facts of enlistment, in this article I will share more
        nuanced information and provide suggestions, based on my own
        experience, to afford you more detail about enlisting in the Army as
        an active-duty soldier, and forgo much of the surface information that
        is easily accessable elsewhere. Army recruitment is a nation wide
        endeavor and is continuously changing. Therefore, some parts of the
        enlistment process may be different for you based on where you are
        located and when you may be reading this.

          which prescribes the official eligibility criteria, policies, and
          procedures for enlistment. In order to determine eligibility, your
          recruiter will have you go through a series of steps which will
          involve: information gathering and documentation, aptitude testing,
          background check, medical and physical evaluation, and job selection.
          Once the process is complete and you have been deemed eligible, you
          may sign your enlistment contract and prepare to ship out to basic
          combat training (BCT). The entire process may take as little as a
          week or as long as a few months or more, depending on your particular
          situation.

          The first step in the enlistment process is not, as so many other
          soruces would suggest, to speak to a recruiter, but to do your
          homework. Research the Army to determine if this is the right path
          for you. Popular sources of information include

          where you can find information about the military occupational
          specialties (MOS) or jobs that the Army provides, one of which you
          must ultimately select during the enlistment process.
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="p">
        While conducting your research, jot down questions that you may have
        for your recruiter for when you meet. This will save both of you time
        and also impress upon your recruiter that you are a serious candidate.
        In turn, it may motivate your recruiter to prioritize your application
        over others'.
      </div>
      <div class="p">
        <span>
          Note that during the research phase of the process you may discover
          the difference between an enlisted soldier and a commissioned
          officer. If you are interested in joining as an officer, explore the
          options that are available and the corresponding eligibility criteria
          as described in the appropriate regulations listed in the
        </span>

        <span>
          Inquire into the process with your recruiter. I will continue
          to focus on active-duty enlistment since that is the experience
          I have and to which I can attest.
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="p">
        Finally, be advised that the Army is a massive organization, and the
        information available about it is equally extensive. Do not get bogged
        down in research. Rather, focus on what specifically interests you and
        concerns that you may have. A good rule of thumb may be to conduct
        research up to the point where you have either decided that you do not,
        in fact, want to enlist, or jotted down as many questions as may occur
        to you to ask your recruiter. Compile a list of the types of questions
        to which the answers will clarify your decision to join.

          After conducting preliminary research, contact your local recruiter
          and set up an appointment. Show up ten minutes early and in business
          casual attire. Be mindful of personal appearance, grooming, and
          hygiene before showing up. If in doubt, reference the appearance and
          grooming policies as prescribed by Army Regulation

          specifically the relevant sections in Chapter 3. While it is not
          necessary to hold yourself to the standards of the Army just yet, you
          may as well get a head start and further impress your recruiter with
          a solid first impression. Remember to bring your State issued
          driver's license or identification card, social security card, and
          birth certificate as instructed by your recruiter.
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="h i">The Q & A</div>
      <div class="p">
        <span>
          The first part of your meeting will likely involve your recruiter
          asking you some basic questions about yourself (similar to questions
          that may have been asked in your initial phone call); questions about
          your age, citizenship, marital status, number of dependents if any,
          current living situation, employment status, level of education,
          health conditions, criminal history and drug use, financial
          obligations (if you have any debts for example), travels and ties to
          foreign countries, your motivations for joining the Army, and so on.
          Answer all questions honestly. Keep your answers short and to the
          point. Avoid an exposition of your entire life. For example, when
          being asked about your health, stick to addressing any major
          surgeries or illnesses for which you were admitted to a hospital or
          clinic and for which medical records exist. There is no need to go
          into every minor cut or bruise that you have ever sustained. The
          recruiter is looking to eliminate any potential red flags that may
          show up on a search for
        </span>
        <span class="i">documented records</span>
        <span>
          that may disqualify you for enlistment. Keep in mind that it is in
          the recruiter's best interest that you enlist and so you are well
          advised not to volunteer any unnecesary information that may hinder
          that goal.

      </div>
      <div class="h i">The Hard Sell</div>
      <div class="p">
        <span>
          Having gained a sense of your situation, the recruiter is likely to
          spend some time elaborating on the benefits the Army provides;
          benefits such as a steady and immediate source of stable income,
          effectively free room and board for single soldiers or housing and
          subsistance (food) allowances for married soldiers, various sign-up
          bonuses pertaining to specific contractual agreements (for example,
          sign-up bonuses for particular jobs), the possibility for travel to
          exotic places and being stationed in a variety of different States
          and countries, the numerous facilities and outlets available on Army
          bases, the many possibilites for career advancement such as attending
          special courses (for example, Airborne), financial assistance for
          education such as the

          tailored to specific jobs, health and medical benefits not just for
          you but also your family (spouse, and children), assistance with
          loans for buying a house, retirement and savings options, and much
          more.
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="p">
        This part of the meeting is often likened to a sales pitch where the
        recruiter is perceived to "sell you" on the Army, and may involve
        misunderstanding that the recruiter is exaggerating or misrepresenting
        the benefits of joining the Army in some way simply to convince you to
        sign on the dotted line. While there may very well be some recruiters
        who resort to dubious sales tactics (mine did not), understand that you
        are free to interrogate the recruiter to clarify the finer points of
        their claims and that it is ultimately your responsibility to verify
        the details of their assertions. This is where your preliminary
        research and list of prepared questions come in handy. Be mindful to
        continue your research throughout the enlistment process as new
        information arise.
      </div>
      <div class="h i">The Fine Print</div>
      <div class="p">
        <span>
          While the Army does indeed provide benefits competitive with many
          civilian jobs, like with any other opportunity it is important to
          read the fine print not only to determine if you actually do qualify
          for those benefits that are of particular interest to you, but to
          understand the steps you may have to take to receive those benefits.
          For example, if you are interested in the Loan Repayment Program,
          which currently offers non-prior, active-duty soldiers, in certain
          jobs, up to a total of $65,000 (less taxes) in repayment towards
          certain types of student loans, you will have to decline enrollment
          in the
        </span>
        <a
          class="a"
          href="https://myarmybenefits.us.army.mil/Benefit-Library/Federal-Benefits/Montgomery-GI-Bill-(MGIB)?serv=122"
          target="_blank">Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB)</a>
        <span>
          in writing included in your first enlistment contract. Had you not
          known of this crucial step and simply waited after signing your
          enlistment contract before delving into the details, you would have
          missed the opportunity altogether.
        </span>
      </div>
      <div class="p">
        A general rule of thumb to receiving benefits from the Army is that
        your chances of doing so are maximized if you read the fine print at
        the time of constructing your enlistment contract (for such benefits as
        can be guaranteed on the contract) because this is the time the Army is
        willing to offer you as much as possible in return for your commitment.
        Once you are committed - which is to say, once you have signed your
        contract - the Army has no further incentive to fulfill your desires
        beyond its own needs and standing obligations.
      </div>
      <div class="h i">The Mock Test</div>
      <div class="p">
        After you have had your conversation with the recruiter and are ready
        to proceed with the enlistment process, the next step on your first
        meeting will be to take a mock aptitude test to get a sense of how you
        will fare in the actual test. This will be a shorter test which will
        take about an hour or less to complete and will include questions
        similar to the real one. Take the test seriously and do your best
        but do not stress about the results - they will not count towards
        anything but the level of preparation that you may have to undertake
        for when you are facing the real thing. Your recruiter may take this
        time to make copies of your driver's license or ID, social securty
        card, and birth cirtificate. Once you complete the test your recruiter
        will score it then and there and talk with you about the results. If
        you pass comfortably then your recruiter will want to schedule the
        actual test as soon as possible. If you score below passing or you just
        barely pass then your recruiter is likely to recommend that you prepare
        more thoroughly and encourage you to stick to a study routine in order
        to pass with a sufficient margin of error (more on this later in the
        "Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery" section below).
      </div>
      <div class="h i">The Next Step</div>
      <div class="p">
        Once you have considered a tentative testing date or have committed to
        a study plan, your recruiter will send you on your way with
        instructions for the next meeting which will involve completing an
        information packet and gathering necessary documents and paperwork.
      </div>
      <div id="documents-and-paperwork" class="b c h l">
        Documents and Paperwork
      </div>
      <div class="p">
        The information packet that you must fill out to enlist will consist of
        a more thorough list of similar questions to the ones that your
        recruiter would have asked you in your first meeting. Completing the
        packet will require three character references who you have known for
        the past ten years, as well as references who can verify your place of
        residence for the past ten years or up to your 16th birthday, and
        references who can verify your employment for the past ten years or up
        to your 17th birthday. These references cannot include family members
        and no refernce can be listed more than once. Information on family
        members will also be required to include your parents, siblings,
        spouse, spouse's parents, and children. Getting in touch with potential
        references and family members ahead of the enlistment process can
        therefore speed up completing the packet.
      </div>
      <div class="p">
        While you should be as accurate as possible in the information you
        provide, do not stress about making mistakes in the packet. The
        physical packet is a precursor to the information that will be entered
        by your recruiter into the Army's electronic system. You will have
        opportunities throughout the process to correct any mistakes. You are
        well advised to sit with and monitor your recruiter's progress during
        the data transfer into the system to correct any errors or
        typographical mistakes in real time.
      </div>
      <div class="p">
        Besides the packet, six other categories of documents may be required
        throughout the enlistment process, with some being mandatory while
        others being circumstantial: identity, educational, medical, marital,
        financial, and legal. Other more detailed sources of information for
        these requirements are widely available so I will briefly mention them
        here. Note that whenever possible, obtain original or official
        documents and records.

        <span>(1) Identity documents</span>
        <span>
          include, as previously mentioned, your State issued driver's license
          or identification card, social security card, and birth cirtificate.
          Other identity documents may include your passport (if any), your
          certificate of naturalization (if you are a naturalized citizen) or
          permanent resident card.

        These categories of documents are not necessarily exhaustive. You may
        be required to provide other documents as needed based on your personal
        situation. While you will have sufficient time to gather documents
        during the enlistment process, now that you are armed with the
        knowledge of a tentative list of documents, you can get a head start
        and shorten the time between meeting with your recruiter for the first
        time and shipping out to basic training. Getting documents out out of
        the way early will also free up your time to focus on the other parts
        of the enlistment process, such as the aptitude test discussed next.

        Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery

      <div class="p">
        <span>
          The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) test is yet
          another necessary part of the enlistment process for which ample
          sources of information exist, most notably the

        <span>
          The test is administered for two main purposes: to qualify for
          enlistment which requires attaining a passing score, and to assess
          aptitude in specific areas of knowledge to qualify for and help
          select a specific job.

      <div class="h i">Format and Verification</div>
      <div class="p">
        <span>
          You may take the paper and pencil (P&P) version of the test, the
          computer adaptive test (CAT-ASVAB), or the untimed and unproctored
          prescreening, internet-delivered computer adaptive test (PiCAT). You
          may take the test at your nearest Military Entrance Processing
          Station (MEPS), at your recruiter's office, or in the case of the
          PiCAT, at home at your own convenience, or at your recruiter's
          office. If you take the PiCAT at your recruiter's office (as I did)
          or at home, you will have to take a verification test at MEPS within
          a certain time frame (my recruiter drove me to MEPS the same day for
          verification). The verification test is a shorter version of the test
          with some questions being exactly the same as the one you took while
          a few may be different. For those questions that are exactly the
          same, answer them exactly as you did on the PiCAT even if you
          realized at some point that you had answered them incorrectly on the
          actual test. The verification test is proctored to ensure that you
          are indeed the same person who took the actual test and that you did
          not cheat. Therefore, it is in your best interest to match all
          answers on the verification test to the actual one. Note that some
          percentage of random test takers will have to take the entire test
          again instead of the short version (to ensure testing validity).
          After the verification test is complete you will have to answer a
          different set of questions related to your personality profile. This
          set of questions will have no bearing on your enlistment.

      <div class="h i">Percentile and Composite Scores</div>
      <div class="p">
        The Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) percentile score derived
        from certain sub-sections of the ASVAB, determines your eligibility to
        join based on a cutoff threshold. For some, the threshold to enlist in
        the Army is set at 31 percentile points, and for others at 50
        percentile points (at the time of this writing), depending on whether
        you have a highschool diploma, a GED, or other factors that may be
        applicable to you and that your recruiter can explain.
      </div>
      <div class="p">
        Composite scores, often referred to as line scores, are a set of scores
        derived from a combination of sub-sections. These line scores assess
        specific areas of strength or weakness to determine your eligibility
        for specific jobs. If there is a certain job that you are interested in
        then you are well advised to spend more time in preparing for the
        sub-section(s) of the test that will contribute to the particular line
        score(s) needed for that job.

          If you wish to rise to the ranks of Warrant Officers in the course of
          your Army career, know that to do so will also require, in some
          cases, a minimum line score threshold in the subject area relevant to
          the desired

          Therefore, it is in your best interest to do well on the ASVAB not
          only for initial eligibility and job selection but also potentially
          for some long term career aspirations.

          While the ASVAB is not only a necessary step but a crucial one in
          determining the course of your potential Army career, and while you
          may improve your score marginally or perhaps even significantly with
          study, it is important to keep in mind that the results of the test
          are but one
        </span>
        <span class="i">measure of performance</span><span>,</span>
        <span>
          which reflects your aptitude - a characteristic that is to some
          extent innate (consider child prodigies or the cognitively
          encumbered). Neither pride nor shame is as helpful a response to your
          score as an objective and dispassionate recognition of your abilities
          at the time. Whether you have passed with flying colors, just barely,
          or with scores somewhere in between, carry on knowing that there is
          much more to being a good soldier than what any one metric can tell.
